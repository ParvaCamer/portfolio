The idea was that users scan the QR connection code at the entrance of the fire station to create an account first. Then to scan the QR codes of the questions located at the corresponding stands, inside the barrack. I wanted to make sure that the organizer could create a new activity, then modify or delete it afterwards, without asking me. By creating an activity, a QR code is automatically generated, thus linking the question with this QR code. The activity works like a quiz : there are a question and proposals. And if you answer correctly, you get a point. The application had to be responsive, because people were going to use their phone to scan the QR code. Some modifications have been made on this project so that you can have a better experience when using it",
